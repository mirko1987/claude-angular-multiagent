# 🚀 Final Instructions - Testing and Publishing

## STEP 1: Create Test Pull Request (2 minutes)

### 1.1 Open the Link
Go to: **https://github.com/mirko1987/claude-angular-multiagent/pull/new/test/ai-review-demo**

### 1.2 Fill Out the PR
**Title:**
```
🧪 Test: AI Code Review Action
```

**Description:** (Copy all the text below)
```markdown
# 🧪 Test: AI Code Review Action

## Objective
Test the AI Code Review GitHub Action on a component with intentional issues.

## Modified Files
- ✅ `.github/workflows/test-action.yml` - Test workflow
- ✅ `test/test-component.ts` - Component with intentional issues

## Intentional Code Issues
This component deliberately contains several issues that the AI should detect:

### 🔴 Critical (Security)
1. **SQL Injection** (line 27-29) - Query built with string concatenation
2. **XSS Vulnerability** (line 33-35) - innerHTML with unsanitized user data
3. **SQL Injection in INSERT** (line 41-44) - Template string with unescaped data
4. **Sensitive Data Logging** (line 52-54) - Password logged to console

### 🟡 Important (Performance & Architecture)
5. **Memory Leak** (line 21-24) - Observable interval never unsubscribed
6. **Subject Not Completed** (line 47-49) - Subject never completed in ngOnDestroy
7. **Missing OnPush** - No optimized change detection strategy
8. **Direct Database Access** - Component accesses database directly

## Expected Result
The AI should find and report all these issues with:
- Correct severity (critical, major, minor)
- File and line number
- Fix suggestions

## How to Test
1. ✅ Create this PR
2. ⏱️ Wait for GitHub Actions to complete (~30-60 seconds)
3. 💬 Check the AI comment with findings
4. ✅ Verify all issues were detected

## Notes
⚠️ This is a test - **DO NOT merge this PR!**
The code deliberately contains vulnerabilities to test the AI.

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Fail on Critical Issues
\`\`\`yaml
- uses: mirko1987/claude-angular-multiagent@v1
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: \${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    fail-on-critical: true  # Block PR merge
\`\`\`

### Cost Control
\`\`\`yaml
- uses: mirko1987/claude-angular-multiagent@v1
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: \${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    cost-budget: '0.10'      # Max $0.10
    max-concurrent: 1         # Sequential execution
\`\`\`

### Custom File Pattern
\`\`\`yaml
- uses: mirko1987/claude-angular-multiagent@v1
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: \${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    files-pattern: 'apps/**/src/**/*.ts'  # For monorepos
\`\`\`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No API credits" error
Add credits at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing

### "No files found" error
Check that `files-pattern` matches your project structure

### Action times out
- Use `review-mode: 'cost'` or `'speed'`
- Reduce `cost-budget` and `time-budget`
